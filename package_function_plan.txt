POTENTIAL LIST OF FUNCTIONS FOR NESTTOOL TOOLKIT
-data_prep
-move_metric_extraction(trackfile,seasonstart,seasonend,latlong bbox, subset) ; output: data frames with variables for individuals, potential nest coordinates
-train_nest_detect
-nest_detect(trackfile, output from move_metric_extraction, training_data) ; if user has training data (with known nest and no nest), then model can be built using those data, otherwise model trained on Swiss kites will be used to predict whether a nest exists; output will be a data.frame with all predictor variables and nest_prob value that is used to flag up which ind to annotate manually
-predict_settlement: takes output of nest_detect that predicts NO nest and then divides into settled or not
-train_nest_outcome
-predict_outcome(output from nest_detect, training data) ; if user has training data (with successful nest and failed nest), then model can be built using those data, otherwise model trained on Swiss kites will be used to predict breeding success; output will be a data.frame with all predictor variables and succ_prob value that is used to flag up which ind to annotate manually
- plot_move_metrics(output of move_metric_extraction, subset)
- annotate_manual(outputs from other functions as data frames or csv files, subset, tolerance level to specify what level of uncertainty the user wants to annotate manually); launches shiny app and writes csv table with nest outcomes.
